## How to get started

Being in its early days, MonkAI requires the support of Computer Vision and Deep Learning enthusiasts to support the design and development. In its current form, MonkAI supports :

1. [Image Classification using Transfer Learning](https://github.com/Tessellate-Imaging/monk_v1)
2. [Object Detection workflows with a variety of Deep Neural architectures](https://github.com/Tessellate-Imaging/Monk_Object_Detection)
3. [Custom Neural Network designer](https://github.com/Tessellate-Imaging/monk_v1/blob/master/tutorials/8%20-%20Custom%20Model%20Creation%20and%20debugging%20With%20Monk.ipynb)
4. [MonkAI Studio - for a GUI based classification and detection workflows](https://github.com/Tessellate-Imaging/Monk_Gui)

Any open source experience will help you prepare for GSoC, so don't worry too much about what project you try first and don't be afraid to change your mind!
